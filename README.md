# Any Distrubuation not made my Mediblade or Tqco_Tuesdqy is not valid. 
# If a one has any problems or concerns they may contact Mediblade using Discord: Vixel#1047
# If one contacts staff without letting me know and I get into any issue I should not be getting any warnings.
# As this already says to contact me. 
# I have gotten a warning even though this is fully user friendly and no Extreme Disrespect.
# This is why contact me before staff as staff gets to conclusion fast without any evidence.
# I have rechecked my codes and files to my concern that there is no invalid/disrespectful file.
